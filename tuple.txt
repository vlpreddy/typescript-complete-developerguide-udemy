tuple, you cannot change the order of the data types when you adding data to it. tuple almost similar to array but it has its own specific
const pepsi = [string, boolean, number] = ['brown', true, 40]; 

type Drink = [string, boolean, number];
const pepsi : Drink = ['brown', true, 40]; 
const sprite : Drink = ['clear', true, 40];
